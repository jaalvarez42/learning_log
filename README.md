# Learning Log
## Description
This website was made from a tutorial in Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming, 2nd Edition, by Eric Matthes. It allows for users to keep track of their learning, by creating entries and organizing those entries by topics. Users can create accounts and can create, edit, and view entries they have made.
## Languages/Tools used
- Python
- HTML
- Django
## Possible Improvements
- Email confirmation for accounts created to reduce spam accounts.
- Could include a public aspect to the website where users could choose whether an entry is public or private, so users can share with others things they are learning. Which could lead to users sharing knowledge related to the topics with each other.
- Allow users to include images in their entries.
